# 3D to 2D Transformation

## Transformation Rules

(1,0,0) → (a,b)
(0,1,0) → (c,d)
(0,0,1) → (e,f)

## Generalized Formula

The generalized formula for the transformation is:

(x,y,z)→ (a⋅x + c⋅y + e⋅z, b⋅x + d⋅y + f⋅z)

This formula represents the transformation from 3D coordinates to 2D coordinates based on the given rules.
